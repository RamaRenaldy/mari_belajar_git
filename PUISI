Shape Of You

The club is'nt the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and My friend at the table doing shot
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

I'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
last night you are in my room
and now my bed sheet smell ike you
